One of our awesome sponsors this year is Amazon Web Services and one of their engineering teams has created a fun front-end coding challenge and folks who complete it will have a chance to meet and hang out with folks from the team. The first 100 people to complete the coding challenge will be entered to win a ticket to AWS re:Invent in Las Vegas in late November (ticket value is $1799).

### How to complete this coding challenge

* [Download](https://2018.cascadiajs.com/fe-coding-exercise-CascadiaJS.pdf) the Challenge
* Create a [Codepen](https://codepen.io/) and complete all 3 questions.
* Please email a link to the Codepen to cascadiajs-codingchallenge@amazon.com
* Deadline to submit is **Wednesday, Nov 7**.

Once the coding challenge has been received, it will be reviewed by an engineer at AWS. Based on this info, we will be able to pair you up with Amazon engineers onsite at Cascadia to continue the conversation, learn more about the teams they are a part of, and discuss the opportunities available for an engineer at Amazon. Someone from AWS will follow-up with you with more info on where to meet with the engineers onsite once this has been reviewed.

The winner of the re:Invent ticket will be announced the last day of the conference in the AWS Lounge. We will be giving away other goodies like Amazon gift cards, Kindles, Alexa devices, and more in the AWS Lounge throughout the conference for winners selected from those who complete the coding challenge. Swing by the AWS Lounge and check screens for the winners and how to pick these items up.
