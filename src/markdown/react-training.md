### Prerequisites

This workshop is for developers who are familiar with base React JS components, JSX, and modern JavaScript syntax.

### Agenda

**Morning: Context, Higher–Order Components, Render Props, and Forms**

We will start the workshop with covering state management and React’s new context feature. We’ll review best practices on when to pass data as props and when to use context. After that, the workshop will cover the differences between higher order components and render props. Finally, we’ll round out the morning with best practices for forms in React. We’ll look into how to get values in and out of form state, how to manage form validation and display errors, and how to use a validation schema.

**Catered Lunch**

**Afternoon: Routing and Animations**

We will learn how to use declarative component-based routing to segment our React apps. We’ll leverage code-splitting to ensure we don’t load views prematurely. Finally, we’ll learn how to nest routes, handle default cases, and work with query params. For animations, we will create reusable components with animations built in. The animations can have their timing and values customized. Finally, we’ll create components that have animations that are also interactable.
