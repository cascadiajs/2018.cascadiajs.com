In order to make CascadiaJS as inclusive as possible, we have worked to award scholarships to folks who belong to under-represented groups in tech or have financial constraints that would otherwise prevent them from attending. This year we set a goal of funding and awarding 50 scholarships.

**But giving someone a free ticket to a conference isnâ€™t enough!** 

In order to ensure that these folks get the most out of their time at CascadiaJS, we are organizing a Scholar Success Mixer. We have invited a hand-selected group of respected and enthusiastic community members ([Stephanie Hurlburt](https://twitter.com/sehurlburt), [Glenn Block](https://twitter.com/gblock), [Ashley McNamara](https://twitter.com/ashleymcnamara) and others) to help faciliate group discussion on important questions like getting your first tech job and how to network effectively at a conference. 

If you are a scholarship recipient or are relatively new to the tech community and would benefit from attending this event prior to CascadiaJS 2018, please RSVP below.
