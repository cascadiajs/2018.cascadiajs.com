In order to make CascadiaJS as inclusive as possible, we have worked to award scholarships to folks who belong to under-represented groups in tech or have financial constraints that would otherwise prevent them from attending. This year we set a goal of **funding** and **awarding** 50 scholarships.

But giving someone a free ticket to a conference isn’t enough! In order to ensure that these folks get the most out of their time at CascadiaJS, we are organizing a Scholar Success Mixer. The goal of this event is to invite respected and enthusiastic community members to give back and connect with people are new to the Tech community or early in their career. These mentors will help faciliate group discussion on important questions like getting your first tech job and how to network effectively at a conference. 

Our hope is that this event will help prepare our scholarship recipients to get the most out of the CascadiaJS experience.
