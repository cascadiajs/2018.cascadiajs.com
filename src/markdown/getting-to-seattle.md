## Schedule

In order to best plan your stay, here is a rough schedule of events. We will continue adding more and more fun activities, but these are the core parts of CascadiaJS:

* **Thursday:** Day One Talks & Opening Party
* **Friday:** Day Two Talks & Closing Party
* **Saturday:** - React Training (9am - 4pm)

## Crossing the Border to the United States

If you are traveling to the United States from another country, **PLEASE** ensure that you research the requirements for travel to the United States from your country of origin, including Passports and potential Visa requirements.

All aboard the Hacker Train! If you live in Portland, OR or Vancouver, BC there is **no better way** to get to CascadiaJS than to join your fellow devs on the Hacker Train. We have bought out cars on both a northbound train departing Portland, OR and a southbound train departing Vancouver, BC so that you can make some friends, fork repos on the in-train Wi-Fi and enjoy the beautiful views along the Puget Sound as you head to Seattle.

*NOTE: the Hacker Train is one way! Make sure you book a return trip*

### Directions from the King St Station to the Moxy Seattle or Thompson Seattle hotels

We advise using a car sharing service, there aren't great public transportation options here and it's not very walkable.

## SeaTac Airport

SeaTac Airport has a dedicated ride sharing area served by Uber and Lyft. A ride into downtown Seattle will run around $35.

Another great option is to take the [Light Rail](https://www.soundtransit.org/Schedules/Link-light-rail) downtown. Get off at the Westlake Station and you will be walking distance to either hotel.
