## Crossing the Border to the United States

## Hacker Trains

All aboard the Hacker Train! If you live in Portland, OR or Vancouver, BC there is **no better way** to get to CascadiaJS than to join your fellow devs on the Hacker Train. We have bought out cars on both a northbound train departing Portland, OR and a southbound train departing Vancouver, BC so that you can make some friends, fork repos on the in-train Wi-Fi and enjoy the beautiful views along the Puget Sound as you head to Seattle.

*NOTE: the Hacker Train is one way! Make sure you book a return trip*

### Directions from the King St Station to the Moxy Seattle or Thompson Seattle hotels

We advise using a car sharing service, there aren't great public transportation options here and it's not very walkable.

## SeaTac Airport

SeaTac Airport has a dedicated ride sharing area served by Uber and Lyft. A ride into downtown Seattle will run around $35.

Another great option is to take the [Light Rail](https://www.soundtransit.org/Schedules/Link-light-rail) downtown. Get off at the Westlake Station and you will be walking distance to either hotel.
