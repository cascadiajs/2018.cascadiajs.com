      <h1>Coding for Kids Workshop Day</h1>
      <img alt="kid coding" src="/catherine-shadow.svg" id={styles.hero}/>
      <p>CascadiaJS and Microsoft are co-hosting a Coding for Kids workshop at the Microsoft Reactor in South Lake Union. This event is inspired by a <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2018/will-8-year-old-girl-stick-coding-fun-project-dad-attracts-gifts-tech-community/">cool experience</a> that a local 2nd grader had learning to code and collecting dev stickers this past summer. The goal of this event is to introduce area kids to coding in a <strong>welcoming</strong> and <strong>fun</strong> environment. We will have a bunch of different workshops targeted at different age groups, so there should be something for everybody. Here are some important details:</p>

        <h3>Tessel Photo-Tweeter</h3>
        <p><img src="/tessel.png" alt="Tessel tweet"/></p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Build a portable photo-bot that takes pictures and posts them to Twitter! Start by making a social-media-happy robot, then build from there: Can you @-tweet to it to ask it for a photo? What if you could make it take a picture by clapping? What if it did something right before taking the picture that made the photo subjects react? What if it took a picture every 4 seconds, like a time lapse? Extra hardware/sensors will be around, and so will mentors. What will you build?</p>
        <p><strong>Recommended age range:</strong> Middle school and up. No prior experience with software or hardware required. But for the pros, this workshop is designed to let you set your own challenge!</p>
        <p><strong>Required Equipment:</strong> A laptop (not a Chromebook) that can connect to Wi-Fi, ideally with <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node (LTS)</a> pre-installed.</p>

        <h3>Making Art in the Browser</h3>
        <p><img src="/p5js.png" alt="P5.js"/></p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Using code to make cool stuff: A fun introduction! <a href="https://p5js.org/">P5.js</a> is a JavaScript library used by artists and designers to make art, visual designs, animations and more. In this workshop you will learn to program interactive shapes and patterns, right in the browser! Make your own experimental creations that you can share with your friends online. </p>
        <p><strong>Recommended age range:</strong> Recommended for middle school and up. No prior experience with software required.</p>
        <p><strong>Required Equipment:</strong> A laptop that can connect to Wi-Fi.</p>

      <div id="jsquest" className={styles.workshop}>
        <h3>JSQuest</h3>
        <p><img src="/quest.png" alt="JSQuest"/></p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> In JSQuest, students will level up their skills in JavaScript through a series of progressively more challenging coding exercises. As students advance through their quest, they will receive experience points and loot to deck out their own virtual avatar in TwilioQuest, an online training platform built by Twilio. There may even be some rad real-world loot for some adventurers...</p>
        <p><strong>Recommended age range:</strong> 10+</p>
        <p><strong>Required Equipment:</strong> Students will need their own laptop with a modern web browser installed. Ideally, parents should also <a href="https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio">sign up for a Twilio account</a> their student can use to log into TwilioQuest to track their progress. A Twilio account (and the associated TwilioQuest user) is not strictly necessary to participate, but it will make the experience more fun if the student can track their growth inside the game.</p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> In this workshop, we will go over the basic concepts of how to make a computer program using <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>. Scratch, by MIT, allows students to drag and drop logic blocks in a visual interface to create a program. The program comes to life using sprites, backgrounds, and sounds on a stage. By manipulating the order of the logic blocks and their configuration values, students will be able to create an animated story to share with their friends and family.</p>
        <p><strong>Recommended age range:</strong> Grades 1-4, no prior programming experience needed. Participants need to be able to read and do basic addition and subtraction.</p>
        <p><strong>Required Equipment:</strong> A laptop with a web browser and Adobe Flash installed. Optionally, parents can <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">create an account on Scratch</a> so students can save their work.</p>
